* why a new language:

When go was designed that time languages in use were
python,java and c/c++.
python is interpreted language, java and c/c++ have complex type system and not designed keeping concurrency in mind.
c/c++ have high compile time.

 Go (golang)
* strong and statically types
* excellent community
* Simplicity
* Fast compile time
* Garbage collected
* built in concurrency
* compile to one standalone binary.

Topics:
* Variables
* Primitive Types
